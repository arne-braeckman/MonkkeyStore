# Convex Configuration
# Get this URL by running `npx convex dev` in your terminal
# The URL will be displayed when the dev server starts
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment-url.convex.cloud

# Production Only - Do not include in .env.local for development
# Get this from the Convex dashboard for production deployments
# CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=your-production-deploy-key

# Validation Notes:
# - NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL is required for both development and production
# - URL format should be https://[deployment-name].convex.cloud
# - The URL is public (NEXT_PUBLIC prefix) and safe to include in client builds
# - CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY is only needed for production deployments and should be kept secret
