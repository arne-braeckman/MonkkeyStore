# Development Workflow

Prerequisites: You will need git and Node.js installed on your machine.

## Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository from your chosen version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2. Navigate to the project root in your terminal.
3. Run the command npm install to install all dependencies for the monorepo.
4. Create a local environment file (.env) for development.

## Development Commands

- To start the development server: npm run dev
- To run tests: npm run test
- To build the project for production: npm run build

## Environment Configuration

We will handle environment variables using a local .env file for development and a cloud-based configuration on Vercel for production.
