# Monkkey Webshop Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

Establish Monkkey as the go-to brand for unique, personalized gifts, especially within the corporate gifting space.

Attract and retain a loyal customer base for both consumers and corporate clients.

Drive a measurable increase in sales from both the consumer and corporate sectors.

Automate key tasks to reduce the manual effort required for a one-person business, including managing inventory, processing orders, and handling shipments.

### Background Context

The modern gift-giving market is dominated by large e-commerce platforms where consumers default to traditional, mass-produced gifts. This trend has led to a lack of personality and originality in gift-giving, eroding its emotional value. Monkkey's webshop will provide a custom-built solution offering unique, handcrafted, and personalized items to both individual consumers and corporate clients. By providing a streamlined experience for custom orders and an efficient backend for a one-person operation, Monkkey aims to create a platform that delivers true happiness and fosters better relationships through meaningful gifts.

## Requirements

### Functional

FR1: Product Catalog & Display: The webshop must display all products with high-quality images, detailed descriptions, pricing, and available customization options.

FR2: Search & Filtering: The webshop must provide a search bar and filtering options (e.g., by product type, material, or price) to help users find products easily.

FR3: Shopping Cart Management: The webshop must allow users to add products to a shopping cart, view and modify the contents of the cart, and proceed to checkout.

FR4: Personalization Engine: The webshop must enable users to add personal messages or images to their products for engraving.

FR5: Gift Box Builder: The webshop must provide a dedicated interface that allows users to select multiple products and combine them into a single gift box.

FR6: Product Recommendations: The webshop must suggest other complementary products to the user based on their selections (the "Monkkey Mix" feature).

FR7: Secure Checkout Process: The webshop must provide a secure and streamlined checkout flow that captures all necessary customer, billing, and shipping information.

FR8: Payment Processing: The webshop must integrate with a payment gateway to accept payments from multiple sources (e.g., credit cards, PayPal).

FR9: Order Management System: The webshop must provide a backend interface for the business owner to view, track, and manage all orders from the point of purchase to delivery.

FR10: Inventory Management: The webshop must allow the business owner to track and update stock levels for all products and receive alerts for low stock.

FR11: Content Management System (CMS): The webshop must provide an administrative interface to manage and update all product information, categories, and website content (e.g., About Us page, blog posts).

FR12: Analytics & Reporting: The webshop must provide a dashboard with key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales data, website traffic, and customer behavior.

FR13: Customer Communication: The webshop must automatically send email notifications for order confirmations, shipping updates, and other critical communications.

FR14: B2B Functionality: The webshop must include a separate interface or workflow for corporate clients to facilitate bulk orders and manage B2B transactions.

### Non-Functional

NFR1: Performance & Scalability: The webshop must load pages quickly (target: under 3 seconds), even under moderate traffic. The architecture should be scalable to handle seasonal peaks, such as the holiday season, without a significant degradation in performance.

NFR2: Security & Compliance: The platform must be secure. This includes protecting personal identification data (like names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses), securing the payment gateway, and handling all customer data in a compliant manner. It should also prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

NFR3: Reliability & Resilience: The webshop must be highly reliable, with minimal downtime. The system should be able to handle errors gracefully and recover quickly from unexpected failures.

NFR4: Usability & Accessibility: The interface must be intuitive and easy to use for all customers, with clear navigation and a logical flow. The design should also be accessible to users with disabilities, following established web accessibility standards.

NFR5: Cross-Platform Compatibility: The webshop must function and display correctly across all modern web browsers and devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

NFR6: Maintainability: The codebase must be well-structured and documented, making it easy to maintain and extend with new features in the future, even by a single person.

NFR-TBD: Personalization Preview (Future): The system should provide a dynamic, real-time preview of personalized messages or images on the product model before the user adds it to their cart. This is an important feature, but it will not be included in the initial MVP.

## User Interface Design Goals

This section captures the high-level UI/UX vision to guide the design and inform story creation. It focuses on the product vision and user goals, not on a detailed technical specification.

### Overall UX Vision

The overall UX vision is to create a platform that feels as handcrafted and personal as the products themselves. The design should be warm, inviting, and trustworthy, with an emphasis on clarity over complexity. The user journey should feel like a guided, creative experience rather than a transactional one.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

Customization Interface: The user must be able to add personal messages or images to products via a simple, intuitive interface that includes a text box with character limitations and an image upload feature. The products must have clear visual indicators of where personalization will be applied.

Intuitive Gift Box Builder: The process of combining multiple products into a gift box should be intuitive, similar to building a collection or a playlist.

Streamlined Checkout: The checkout process must be frictionless, with a clear summary of the order and a seamless payment experience.

Dual-Interface Experience: The UI must visually and functionally differentiate between the consumer and corporate experiences without causing confusion.

### Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, these are the most critical screens needed to deliver the core value of the webshop.

Homepage: A welcoming and inspiring entry point that showcases Monkkey's unique value proposition and a curated selection of products.

Product Detail Page: A highly visual page with high-quality images, detailed descriptions, and all personalization options.

Gift Box Builder Page: An interactive page where users can select and assemble a custom gift box.

Shopping Cart: A clear, easy-to-edit summary of the user's selected products.

Checkout Flow: A multi-step process for entering shipping, billing, and payment information.

Corporate Interface: A distinct portal for B2B clients to manage bulk orders.

Order Confirmation Page: A page that confirms the order and provides a sense of gratitude and finality.

### Accessibility

We will adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) at the AA level. This is a common and robust standard that ensures the site is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for a wide range of users.

### Target Device and Platforms

Based on the nature of e-commerce, the target platform is a Web Responsive design that works flawlessly across all modern web browsers and mobile devices.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure

We will use a Monorepo structure. This approach uses a single repository for all code, including the frontend, backend, shared types, and configuration. It is an excellent fit for the T3 stack and a one-person team because it simplifies dependency management and ensures full-stack type safety out of the box.

### Service Architecture

We will leverage a Serverless approach within a monolithic T3 project. This is a common and highly effective pattern that allows for a simple project structure while providing the scalability and cost-efficiency of serverless functions. Next.js natively supports this with API routes and server components.

### Testing Requirements

For the MVP, we will focus on Unit + Integration Testing. This approach strikes a good balance between development speed and code quality, providing a solid safety net against bugs and regressions without the significant time investment required for a full testing pyramid.

## Epic List

Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure - This epic will establish the project's base, including the monorepo structure, initial serverless functions, database setup, and core user-facing functionality like a product display page.

Epic 2: Personalized Gifting - This epic will focus on building the core user journeys for customization, including the image upload and text engraving features for personalized products.

Epic 3: Gift Box Builder - This epic will create the dedicated interface for building custom gift boxes, enabling users to combine multiple products into a single order.

Epic 4: Checkout & Order Management - This epic will focus on the secure checkout process, including payment processing and the backend system for order and inventory management.

Epic 5: B2B Functionality - This epic will develop the separate interface and bulk ordering workflow for corporate clients, allowing for large-volume transactions.
