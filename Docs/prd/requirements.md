FR3: Shopping Cart Management: The webshop must allow users to add products to a shopping cart, view and modify the contents of the cart, and proceed to checkout.

FR4: Personalization Engine: The webshop must enable users to add personal messages or images to their products for engraving.

FR5: Gift Box Builder: The webshop must provide a dedicated interface that allows users to select multiple products and combine them into a single gift box.

FR6: Product Recommendations: The webshop must suggest other complementary products to the user based on their selections (the "Monkkey Mix" feature).

FR7: Secure Checkout Process: The webshop must provide a secure and streamlined checkout flow that captures all necessary customer, billing, and shipping information.

FR8: Payment Processing: The webshop must integrate with a payment gateway to accept payments from multiple sources (e.g., credit cards, PayPal).

FR10: Inventory Management: The webshop must allow the business owner to track and update stock levels for all products and receive alerts for low stock.

FR11: Content Management System (CMS): The webshop must provide an administrative interface to manage and update all product information, categories, and website content (e.g., About Us page, blog posts).

FR12: Analytics & Reporting: The webshop must provide a dashboard with key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales data, website traffic, and customer behavior.

FR13: Customer Communication: The webshop must automatically send email notifications for order confirmations, shipping updates, and other critical communications.

## Non-Functional

NFR1: Performance & Scalability: The webshop must load pages quickly (target: under 3 seconds), even under moderate traffic. The architecture should be scalable to handle seasonal peaks, such as the holiday season, without a significant degradation in performance.

NFR2: Security & Compliance: The platform must be secure. This includes protecting personal identification data (like names, addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses), securing the payment gateway, and handling all customer data in a compliant manner. It should also prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

NFR3: Reliability & Resilience: The webshop must be highly reliable, with minimal downtime. The system should be able to handle errors gracefully and recover quickly from unexpected failures.

NFR4: Usability & Accessibility: The interface must be intuitive and easy to use for all customers, with clear navigation and a logical flow. The design should also be accessible to users with disabilities, following established web accessibility standards.

NFR5: Cross-Platform Compatibility: The webshop must function and display correctly across all modern web browsers and devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

NFR6: Maintainability: The codebase must be well-structured and documented, making it easy to maintain and extend with new features in the future, even by a single person.

NFR-TBD: Personalization Preview (Future): The system should provide a dynamic, real-time preview of personalized messages or images on the product model before the user adds it to their cart. This is an important feature, but it will not be included in the initial MVP.
