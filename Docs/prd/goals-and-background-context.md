# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

Establish Monkkey as the go-to brand for unique, personalized gifts, especially within the corporate gifting space.

Attract and retain a loyal customer base for both consumers and corporate clients.

Drive a measurable increase in sales from both the consumer and corporate sectors.

Automate key tasks to reduce the manual effort required for a one-person business, including managing inventory, processing orders, and handling shipments.

## Background Context

The modern gift-giving market is dominated by large e-commerce platforms where consumers default to traditional, mass-produced gifts. This trend has led to a lack of personality and originality in gift-giving, eroding its emotional value. Monkkey's webshop will provide a custom-built solution offering unique, handcrafted, and personalized items to both individual consumers and corporate clients. By providing a streamlined experience for custom orders and an efficient backend for a one-person operation, Monkkey aims to create a platform that delivers true happiness and fosters better relationships through meaningful gifts.
