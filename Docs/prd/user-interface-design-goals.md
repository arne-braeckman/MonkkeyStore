# User Interface Design Goals

This section captures the high-level UI/UX vision to guide the design and inform story creation. It focuses on the product vision and user goals, not on a detailed technical specification.

## Overall UX Vision

The overall UX vision is to create a platform that feels as handcrafted and personal as the products themselves. The design should be warm, inviting, and trustworthy, with an emphasis on clarity over complexity. The user journey should feel like a guided, creative experience rather than a transactional one.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

Customization Interface: The user must be able to add personal messages or images to products via a simple, intuitive interface that includes a text box with character limitations and an image upload feature. The products must have clear visual indicators of where personalization will be applied.

Intuitive Gift Box Builder: The process of combining multiple products into a gift box should be intuitive, similar to building a collection or a playlist.

Streamlined Checkout: The checkout process must be frictionless, with a clear summary of the order and a seamless payment experience.

Dual-Interface Experience: The UI must visually and functionally differentiate between the consumer and corporate experiences without causing confusion.

## Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, these are the most critical screens needed to deliver the core value of the webshop.

Homepage: A welcoming and inspiring entry point that showcases Monkkey's unique value proposition and a curated selection of products.

Product Detail Page: A highly visual page with high-quality images, detailed descriptions, and all personalization options.

Gift Box Builder Page: An interactive page where users can select and assemble a custom gift box.

Shopping Cart: A clear, easy-to-edit summary of the user's selected products.

Checkout Flow: A multi-step process for entering shipping, billing, and payment information.

Corporate Interface: A distinct portal for B2B clients to manage bulk orders.

Order Confirmation Page: A page that confirms the order and provides a sense of gratitude and finality.

## Accessibility

We will adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) at the AA level. This is a common and robust standard that ensures the site is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for a wide range of users.

## Target Device and Platforms

Based on the nature of e-commerce, the target platform is a Web Responsive design that works flawlessly across all modern web browsers and mobile devices.
