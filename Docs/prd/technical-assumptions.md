# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure

We will use a Monorepo structure. This approach uses a single repository for all code, including the frontend, backend, shared types, and configuration. It is an excellent fit for the T3 stack and a one-person team because it simplifies dependency management and ensures full-stack type safety out of the box.

## Service Architecture

We will leverage a Serverless approach within a monolithic T3 project. This is a common and highly effective pattern that allows for a simple project structure while providing the scalability and cost-efficiency of serverless functions. Next.js natively supports this with API routes and server components.

## Testing Requirements

For the MVP, we will focus on Unit + Integration Testing. This approach strikes a good balance between development speed and code quality, providing a solid safety net against bugs and regressions without the significant time investment required for a full testing pyramid.
