# Risk Profile: Story 1.3

Date: 2025-09-07
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 6
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 63/100 (Moderate Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Authentication Context Deferred

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Explicitly stated in AC 3 that authentication is deferred
**Impact**: High - All API endpoints will be unprotected initially
**Mitigation**:

- Document security assumptions and risks clearly
- Implement basic request logging and monitoring
- Plan authentication story as immediate next priority
- Consider basic IP-based restrictions for initial deployment
**Testing Focus**: Security scanning of exposed endpoints, penetration testing

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Security: 2 risks (1 critical)
- Performance: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Data: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Technical: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Operational: 1 risk (0 critical)

### By Component

- tRPC Configuration: 3 risks
- API Endpoints: 2 risks
- Data Access Layer: 1 risk
- TypeScript Setup: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID   | Description                    | Probability | Impact     | Score | Category     |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | ------------ |
| SEC-001   | Authentication context deferred| High (3)    | High (3)   | 9     | Security     |
| DATA-001  | Convex integration coupling    | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | Data         |
| TECH-001  | tRPC configuration complexity  | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Technical    |
| SEC-002   | Missing rate limiting          | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Security     |
| PERF-001  | Type safety overhead           | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Performance  |
| OPS-001   | TypeScript config complexity   | Medium (2)  | Low (1)    | 2     | Operational  |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Security Testing**: Scan for exposed endpoints without authentication
- **Penetration Testing**: Attempt unauthorized access to API procedures
- **Access Control Testing**: Verify context setup allows for future auth integration

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Integration Testing**: Verify Repository pattern abstraction works correctly
- **Vendor Lock-in Testing**: Test data export functionality from Convex layer
- **Migration Testing**: Validate that tRPC can be swapped if needed

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Configuration Testing**: Verify tRPC setup works across development environments
- **Performance Testing**: Measure type validation overhead in realistic scenarios
- **TypeScript Testing**: Verify type safety works end-to-end

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- SEC-001: Implement authentication or accept documented security risk
- Consider adding basic rate limiting (SEC-002)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- DATA-001: Acceptable with strict Repository pattern adherence
- TECH-001: Acceptable with proper testing and documentation

### Accepted Risks

- PERF-001: Type safety overhead acceptable for benefits gained
- OPS-001: TypeScript complexity manageable with team expertise

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **API Access Patterns**: Monitor unusual activity on unprotected endpoints
- **Performance Metrics**: Track API response times and type validation overhead
- **Error Rates**: Monitor tRPC configuration and integration errors
- **Security Events**: Alert on suspicious API access patterns

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Authentication implementation begins
- Performance requirements are defined
- Additional tRPC procedures are added
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
- Production monitoring reveals new issues

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Document Security Risk**: Clearly document the authentication deferral risk
2. **Basic Monitoring**: Implement request logging for security visibility
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding basic rate limiting middleware

### Next Sprint Priority

1. **Authentication Story**: Make authentication implementation high priority
2. **Security Review**: Conduct security assessment before production deployment

### Long-term Considerations

1. **Vendor Lock-in Mitigation**: Maintain strict Repository pattern adherence
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Establish baseline metrics for API performance
3. **Security Hardening**: Implement comprehensive API security measures
