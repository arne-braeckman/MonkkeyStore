# NFR Assessment: 1.3

Date: 2025-09-07
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Authentication deferred; missing rate limiting
- Performance: CONCERNS - No response time targets specified
- Reliability: PASS - Comprehensive error handling implemented
- Maintainability: PASS - Strong type safety and testing foundation

## Critical Issues

1. **Authentication Deferred** (Security)
   - Risk: API endpoints will be unprotected initially
   - Context: Explicitly deferred to future stories per AC 3
   - Recommendation: Ensure security story is prioritized in next sprint

2. **No Rate Limiting** (Security)
   - Risk: Potential DoS attacks on tRPC endpoints
   - Fix: Add rate limiting middleware to tRPC configuration
   - Effort: ~2 hours

3. **No Performance Requirements** (Performance)
   - Risk: No clear success criteria for response times
   - Fix: Define response time targets (suggest <200ms for API calls)
   - Effort: ~1 hour planning

## Quick Wins

- Add rate limiting to tRPC middleware: ~2 hours
- Define performance targets in acceptance criteria: ~1 hour
- Add basic API monitoring/logging: ~1 hour

## Strengths

- Strong error handling foundation with existing system integration
- Type safety reduces runtime errors significantly
- Repository pattern maintains good abstraction
- Comprehensive testing requirements specified
- Integration with existing performance monitoring from Story 1.2

## Recommendations

**Before Implementation:**
1. Consider adding basic rate limiting even with authentication deferred
2. Define minimum performance expectations

**Future Stories:**
1. Prioritize authentication implementation
2. Add comprehensive API security measures
3. Implement performance monitoring dashboard
