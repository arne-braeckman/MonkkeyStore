## Risk Mitigation Details

### TECH-001: Monorepo Configuration Complexity
**Strategy:** Preventive  
**Actions:**
1. Create minimal test packages first to verify workspace setup
2. Document exact npm commands for workspace operations
3. Set up TypeScript project references correctly
4. Test build and type checking across packages

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit test for workspace resolution
- Integration test for cross-package imports
- Build verification across all workspaces

**Residual Risk:** Low - Some edge cases may emerge during development  
**Owner:** Developer  
**Timeline:** During initial setup

### TECH-002: TypeScript Strict Mode Issues
**Strategy:** Preventive  
**Actions:**
1. Start with recommended strict settings from T3 stack
2. Document any necessary exceptions
3. Configure path aliases consistently across workspaces
4. Set up composite projects for efficient type checking

**Testing Requirements:**
- Type checking must pass in all workspaces
- Verify path aliases work in both dev and build

**Residual Risk:** Low - May need adjustments as code grows  
**Owner:** Developer  
**Timeline:** During TypeScript configuration

### OPS-001: Development Environment Inconsistency
**Strategy:** Detective & Corrective  
**Actions:**
1. Create environment setup verification script
2. Document specific versions for Node.js, npm, and tools
3. Add .nvmrc file for Node version
4. Test on multiple operating systems

**Testing Requirements:**
- Setup script works on Mac/Windows/Linux
- Clear error messages for missing dependencies

**Residual Risk:** Medium - Some OS-specific issues may persist  
**Owner:** Developer  
**Timeline:** Before team onboarding

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
1. **Monorepo Functionality**
   - Verify workspace package resolution
   - Test cross-package imports
   - Validate TypeScript project references
   - Confirm build scripts work for all packages

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Test setup on fresh machines
   - Verify all scripts work correctly
   - Check Node/npm version compatibility

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
1. **Configuration Validation**
   - ESLint rules apply correctly
   - Prettier formats consistently
   - TypeScript strict mode works
   - Git ignores appropriate files

2. **Documentation Verification**
   - README instructions are accurate
   - All commands work as documented
   - Troubleshooting steps are helpful

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
1. **Developer Experience**
   - Hot reload works properly
   - Build times are acceptable
   - Error messages are clear

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Moving to Next Story
- Monorepo structure must be correctly configured
- Basic npm scripts (dev, build, test) must work
- TypeScript must compile without errors
- Documentation must be complete and accurate

### Can Proceed with Monitoring
- Minor ESLint/Prettier configuration tweaks
- Build performance optimizations
- Additional developer convenience scripts

### Accepted Risks
- Some OS-specific setup variations (documented)
- Initial build performance (will optimize later)
- Limited test coverage (Story 1.6 addresses this)

## Monitoring Requirements

Since this is a foundation story, monitoring focuses on development experience:

1. **Build Performance**
   - Track build times as project grows
   - Monitor TypeScript compilation speed
   - Watch for workspace resolution issues

2. **Developer Feedback**
   - Setup difficulties encountered
   - Configuration pain points
   - Documentation gaps identified

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Track deferred configuration improvements
   - Note any workarounds implemented
   - Document future optimization opportunities

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update this risk profile when:
- Adding new workspaces to monorepo
- Upgrading major dependencies (Next.js, TypeScript)
- Onboarding new team members
- Significant architecture changes
- Performance issues reported

## Recommendations

### Testing Priority
1. Focus on setup verification and documentation accuracy
2. Test monorepo configuration thoroughly
3. Validate all development scripts work correctly

### Development Focus
1. Follow architecture specifications exactly
2. Document every configuration decision
3. Create helper scripts for common tasks
4. Test on multiple environments before considering complete

### Deployment Strategy
- Not applicable for this infrastructure story
- Focus on local development environment success

### Next Steps
1. Implement story with focus on high-risk areas
2. Create comprehensive setup documentation
3. Build verification scripts for environment
4. Test on multiple developer machines before marking complete
