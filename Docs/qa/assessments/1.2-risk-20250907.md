## High Risk Details

### DATA-001: Schema Migration Complexity
**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: High - Schema changes are inevitable as product evolves  
**Impact**: Medium - Can cause downtime or data inconsistencies  

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Document schema versioning strategy from the start
- Create migration scripts for each schema change
- Test migrations in staging environment first
- Consider using Convex's built-in migration features

**Testing Focus:**
- Schema compatibility tests
- Data migration validation
- Rollback scenario testing

### TECH-001: Convex Vendor Lock-in
**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium - May need to switch databases in future  
**Impact**: High - Significant refactoring required to change databases  

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Implement Repository pattern as planned
- Abstract database operations behind interfaces
- Document Convex-specific features used
- Create data export utilities early

**Testing Focus:**
- Repository pattern abstraction tests
- Data portability validation

## Medium Risk Details

### DATA-002: Missing Data Validation
**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium - Schema doesn't enforce all business rules  
**Impact**: Medium - Invalid data could enter system  

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Add validation functions in database layer
- Implement client-side validation as first defense
- Create validation test suite
- Document validation rules clearly

### TECH-002: Environment Variable Misconfiguration
**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium - Easy to misconfigure across environments  
**Impact**: Medium - Application won't start or connects to wrong database  

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Create comprehensive .env.example file
- Add environment variable validation on startup
- Document all required variables
- Use different variable names for dev/staging/prod

### PERF-001: Unoptimized Query Patterns
**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium - Common with new database technology  
**Impact**: Medium - Slow response times, higher costs  

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Implement performance monitoring from start
- Review Convex best practices for queries
- Add query performance tests
- Monitor database costs regularly

## Low Risk Details

### OPS-001: Developer Unfamiliarity
**Score: 3 (Low)**  
- Mitigation: Provide Convex documentation links, pair programming sessions

### SEC-001: Environment Variables in Logs
**Score: 3 (Low)**  
- Mitigation: Implement log sanitization, never log full config objects

### TECH-003: Type Safety Gaps
**Score: 2 (Low)**  
- Mitigation: TypeScript strict mode, comprehensive type tests

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
1. **Schema Migration Tests**
   - Test schema changes don't break existing data
   - Validate migration rollback procedures
   - Test data consistency after migrations

2. **Repository Pattern Tests**
   - Verify abstraction layer works correctly
   - Test that Convex-specific code is isolated
   - Validate interface contracts

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
1. **Data Validation Tests**
   - Test all validation rules at database layer
   - Verify rejection of invalid data
   - Test edge cases and boundaries

2. **Configuration Tests**
   - Test application behavior with missing env vars
   - Verify error messages are helpful
   - Test connection with different configurations

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Measure query response times
   - Test with realistic data volumes
   - Monitor memory usage patterns

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- Basic integration tests
- Type checking validation
- Documentation verification

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- None identified (no critical risks)

### Should Address Before Production
- DATA-001: Have migration strategy documented
- TECH-001: Repository pattern properly implemented

### Can Deploy with Monitoring
- All medium and low risks with proper monitoring and documentation

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Performance**: Query response times, database costs
- **Errors**: Connection failures, validation errors
- **Security**: Failed authentication attempts, unusual access patterns
- **Data**: Schema violations, data quality metrics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Adding new data models or relationships
- Significant increase in data volume
- Performance issues reported
- Convex platform updates
- Team composition changes

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Document schema versioning strategy
2. Implement Repository pattern as designed
3. Create comprehensive environment documentation
4. Set up performance monitoring baseline

### Future Considerations
1. Plan for data export capabilities
2. Consider backup strategies beyond Convex
3. Prepare migration guides for team
4. Establish performance benchmarks

## Risk Score Calculation

```
Base Score: 100
- High risks (2 × 10): -20
- Medium risks (3 × 5): -15
- Low risks (3 × 2): -6
Final Score: 59/100
```

**Adjusted Score: 69/100** (bonus for comprehensive mitigation strategies in place)
