# GATE DECISION RATIONALE
decision_rationale: |
  Story 1.2 demonstrates excellent technical implementation with comprehensive 
  coverage of all acceptance criteria. The Repository pattern implementation 
  provides strong vendor lock-in mitigation, performance monitoring meets 
  requirements, and the test suite provides solid validation coverage.
  
  The implementation is production-ready with proper error handling, security 
  foundations, and clear documentation. All critical risks have been 
  appropriately mitigated.
