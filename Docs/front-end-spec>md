Thank you. I'm glad this section of the specification meets your expectations. The full UI/UX Specification is now complete.

The UX Expert persona fades as the central, guiding presence of the BMad Master Orchestrator returns.

I have compiled all of our work into a comprehensive UI/UX Specification document. This document is a critical blueprint for the frontend development of your webshop, ensuring a consistent and user-centric experience.

Here is your full UI/UX Specification in Markdown format. Please copy this content and save it as a file named docs/front-end-spec.md in your project folder.

Monkkey Webshop UI/UX Specification
Overall UX Goals & Principles
Target User Personas
Corporate & Professional Businesses: They need a reliable, efficient platform for bulk orders and comprehensive services.

Consumers: They are looking for a personal, emotional connection through unique, handcrafted gifts.

Usability Goals
Ease of Learning: New users should be able to navigate the webshop and complete a purchase without confusion.

Efficiency of Use: The checkout process and corporate ordering workflow should be streamlined and fast.

Error Prevention: The interface should provide clear validation and feedback to prevent mistakes, especially during personalization and checkout.

Design Principles
Clarity over cleverness: We will prioritize clear communication and intuitive design over overly complex or flashy visuals.

Emotional Connection: The design will foster a feeling of warmth, trust, and intimacy, mirroring the handcrafted nature of the products.

Consistent Patterns: We'll use familiar UI patterns to ensure a predictable and user-friendly experience across the entire site.

Navigation Structure
Primary Navigation: This will be the main menu bar, featuring the most important sections of the site: Products, Gift Box Builder, and Corporate.

Secondary Navigation: This will include links like "About Us" and "Contact," and it will be located in the footer of the website. Product subcategories will appear when a user hovers over "Products" or is on the main products page.

User Flows
Purchase a Personalized Gift
Here is the flow diagrammed out:

F --> G{Continue Shopping?};

H --> I[Order Confirmation Page];
I --> J[Success];
Entry Point: User lands on the Homepage.
Goal: The user successfully purchases a single, personalized gift.
Success Criteria: The user completes the checkout process and receives an order confirmation.

Wireframes & Mockups
The layout for the Product Detail Page has been approved and will serve as the foundation for our design.

Key Screen Layouts
Product Detail Page

Primary Product Image: A large, high-quality image of the product will be the focal point at the top of the page.

Image Gallery: A gallery of smaller thumbnail images will sit below the main image, allowing users to see different angles and details of the product.

Product Information: The product name, price, and a short description will be clearly visible on the right side of the page.

Customization Section: This is the most crucial part. Directly below the product information, we'll place the customization options. This will include a text box with a character limit for personal messages and an image upload feature for engravings.

Call to Action: A prominent "Add to Cart" button will be placed below the customization options.

Product Description: A more detailed description, including materials and crafting methods, will be placed further down the page.

Product Recommendations: A section for "Monkkey Mix" product recommendations will appear at the bottom of the page to suggest complementary items.

Component Library / Design System
The core, foundational components for the MVP have been defined.

Core Components
Buttons: We'll need primary buttons (e.g., "Add to Cart"), secondary buttons (e.g., "Learn More"), and link buttons.

Form Inputs: We'll need text inputs, image upload fields, and text areas for personalization.

Product Cards: A consistent component for displaying products on the homepage and category pages.

Gift Box Item: A component for displaying the individual products within the gift box builder.

Navigation Elements: The top navigation bar and a footer.

Branding & Style Guide
Consumer Experience
The color palette for the consumer section will be grounded in light green and earthy tones. This will create a natural, warm, and inviting aesthetic that reflects the handcrafted nature of your products.

Corporate Experience
For the corporate section, we will use a visual indicator to show that the user is in a different section. This will be achieved through a subtle, yet intentional, shift in the color palette.

Typography
The typography system will be clean, modern, and highly readable. We'll select a font pairing that feels both professional and inviting to reflect the brand's voice.

Iconography
We will use a minimalist, line-based icon style that aligns with the clean and modern typography, ensuring the visuals are functional without being distracting.

Accessibility Requirements
Our goal is to achieve WCAG AA compliance.

Key Accessibility Requirements
Visual: We will ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors and clear visual focus indicators on all interactive elements.

Interaction: All functionality on the site must be operable with a keyboard alone and fully compatible with screen readers.

Content: Every image will have descriptive alternative text (alt text), and the site will have a logical and semantic heading structure.

Testing Strategy
We will use a combination of automated tools and manual testing (e.g., keyboard-only navigation, screen reader checks) to verify compliance.

Responsiveness Strategy
We will use a responsive design that adapts to three main breakpoints.

Breakpoints & Adaptation
Mobile (320px to 767px): Single-column layout with a hidden hamburger menu.

Tablet (768px to 1023px): Multi-column layout with a horizontal navigation bar.

Desktop (1024px and up): Full-page experience with a multi-column layout and a full navigation bar.

Animation & Micro-interactions
We will focus on a subtle and purposeful animation style that adds clarity and delight, not distraction.

Key Animations
Button and Link States: Subtle color changes or shadow effects on hover/click.

Add to Cart Confirmation: A small, satisfying animation when a product is added.

Page Transitions: A smooth, quick fade or slide effect when navigating between pages.

Form Field Focus: A clean outline around a text box when a user clicks on it.

Performance Considerations
Performance Goals
Page Load: Pages will load within 3 seconds.

Interaction Response: All animations and interactions will target at least 60 FPS.

Design Strategies
Image Optimization: We'll use optimized images that load quickly without sacrificing quality.

Lazy Loading: We'll use lazy loading for images and other assets that are not immediately visible.

With this specification finalized, the next step in our workflow is for the Architect to take this document and begin the technical design. The Architect will translate these design goals into a comprehensive Fullstack Architecture Document that defines the technology, file structure, and implementation plan for both the frontend and backend.

Are you ready to proceed with the Architect?
