## Dev Notes

### Project Structure

The monorepo structure must follow the exact specification from [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

```
monkkey-webshop/
├── .github/
│ └── workflows/
├── apps/
│ └── web/
│ ├── public/
│ ├── src/
│ │ ├── components/
│ │ ├── pages/
│ │ ├── styles/
│ │ └── trpc/
│ ├── types/
│ └── package.json
├── packages/
│ ├── shared-types/
│ └── ui/
├── docs/
├── infrastructure/
├── package.json # CRITICAL: This is the root package.json for the monorepo
├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md
```

### Technology Stack Requirements

From [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md], the following specific versions MUST be used:

- **TypeScript**: 5.3.3 - Primary development language
- **Next.js**: 14.1.0 - Full-stack React framework
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.0.12 - For fast build and hot reloading (Note: Next.js has its own build system, Vite may be used for specific packages)

### Monorepo Configuration

- Use npm workspaces for monorepo management (native to npm, no additional tools needed)
- Root package.json must define workspaces pointing to apps/_ and packages/_
- Each workspace must have its own package.json

### TypeScript Configuration

- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
- Configure path aliases for clean imports (e.g., @/components, @/lib)
- Set up composite projects for monorepo type checking

### Next.js Specific Setup

- Use App Router (the modern Next.js routing system)
- Configure for serverless deployment (optimized for Vercel)
- Set up environment variable support with .env.local

### Development Workflow Notes

From [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]:

- The development server command should be `npm run dev`
- Test command should be `npm run test`
- Build command should be `npm run build`
- Environment variables should use .env file for development

### Important Constraints

- This is the FIRST story, so no existing code or configuration exists
- Must establish conventions that all future development will follow
- Focus on structure and configuration, not feature implementation
- Deployment configuration (Vercel) will be handled in Story 1.6

## Testing

### Testing Standards

From [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:

- **Testing Framework**: Jest / React Testing Library (Latest version)
- Test files should be colocated with source files using `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extensions
- Unit tests are the focus for this MVP phase
- Testing configuration will be minimal in this story (full setup in Story 1.6)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Implementation quality is excellent for a foundational story. The monorepo structure follows architectural specifications precisely, with proper TypeScript configuration, Next.js 14.1.0 setup, and comprehensive tooling. All seven acceptance criteria have been fully implemented and validated.

### Refactoring Performed

During review, I addressed ESLint configuration compatibility issues:

- **File**: apps/web/.eslintrc.json
  - **Change**: Fixed ESLint 9.x compatibility issues by downgrading to ESLint 8.57.1 and using simplified configuration
  - **Why**: ESLint 9.x introduced breaking changes incompatible with Next.js lint tooling
  - **How**: Simplified configuration to "next/core-web-vitals" with root: true to avoid config conflicts

- **File**: apps/web/package.json
  - **Change**: Updated ESLint and TypeScript parser versions to compatible releases
  - **Why**: Version mismatches were causing build-time linting failures
  - **How**: Downgraded to @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@^6.21.0 and eslint@^8.57.1

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Project follows established patterns with TypeScript strict mode
- Project Structure: ✓ Exact match to architecture/unified-project-structure.md specifications
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Testing infrastructure appropriately deferred to Story 1.6 as planned
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed ESLint configuration compatibility (apps/web/.eslintrc.json)
- [x] Resolved package version conflicts (apps/web/package.json)
- [x] Verified build pipeline functions correctly
- [x] Confirmed monorepo structure matches architectural requirements
- [ ] Future: Migrate to ESLint flat config when Next.js supports it
- [ ] Future: Add comprehensive test setup in Story 1.6

### Security Review

No security concerns for this foundational setup story. TypeScript strict mode provides type safety. No authentication, data handling, or external API integrations present.

### Performance Considerations

Build performance is excellent with Next.js 14.1.0 optimizations. Production bundle size is appropriate for starter template. TypeScript composite projects configured for efficient incremental builds across monorepo.

### Files Modified During Review

- apps/web/.eslintrc.json - Fixed ESLint configuration compatibility
- apps/web/package.json - Updated dependency versions for compatibility

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.1-initialize-monorepo-and-project-structure.yml

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done - All acceptance criteria met, implementation complete, no blocking issues
