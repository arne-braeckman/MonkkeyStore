# Story 1.1: Initialize Monorepo and Project Structure

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer  
**I want** a properly configured monorepo with Next.js and TypeScript  
**So that** I have a solid foundation for building the webshop

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Monorepo is initialized with the structure defined in architecture docs
2. Next.js 14.1.0 application is created in `apps/web/`
3. TypeScript 5.3.3 is configured with strict settings
4. Package.json scripts are set up for dev, build, and test commands
5. ESLint and Prettier are configured for code consistency
6. Git repository is initialized with proper .gitignore
7. README.md contains setup and development instructions

- [ ] Create documentation (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Write README.md with project overview
  - [ ] Document setup instructions
  - [ ] Document available npm scripts
  - [ ] Add development workflow guidelines

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure

The monorepo structure must follow the exact specification from [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

```
monkkey-webshop/
├── .github/
│ └── workflows/
├── apps/
│ └── web/
│ ├── public/
│ ├── src/
│ │ ├── components/
│ │ ├── pages/
│ │ ├── styles/
│ │ └── trpc/
│ ├── types/
│ └── package.json
├── packages/
│ ├── shared-types/
│ └── ui/
├── docs/
├── infrastructure/
├── package.json # CRITICAL: This is the root package.json for the monorepo
├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md
```

### Technology Stack Requirements

From [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md], the following specific versions MUST be used:

- **TypeScript**: 5.3.3 - Primary development language
- **Next.js**: 14.1.0 - Full-stack React framework
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.0.12 - For fast build and hot reloading (Note: Next.js has its own build system, Vite may be used for specific packages)

### Monorepo Configuration

- Use npm workspaces for monorepo management (native to npm, no additional tools needed)
- Root package.json must define workspaces pointing to apps/_ and packages/_
- Each workspace must have its own package.json

### TypeScript Configuration

- Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
- Configure path aliases for clean imports (e.g., @/components, @/lib)
- Set up composite projects for monorepo type checking

### Next.js Specific Setup

- Use App Router (the modern Next.js routing system)
- Configure for serverless deployment (optimized for Vercel)
- Set up environment variable support with .env.local

### Development Workflow Notes

From [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]:

- The development server command should be `npm run dev`
- Test command should be `npm run test`
- Build command should be `npm run build`
- Environment variables should use .env file for development

### Important Constraints

- This is the FIRST story, so no existing code or configuration exists
- Must establish conventions that all future development will follow
- Focus on structure and configuration, not feature implementation
- Deployment configuration (Vercel) will be handled in Story 1.6

## Testing

### Testing Standards

From [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:

- **Testing Framework**: Jest / React Testing Library (Latest version)
- Test files should be colocated with source files using `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extensions
- Unit tests are the focus for this MVP phase
- Testing configuration will be minimal in this story (full setup in Story 1.6)
