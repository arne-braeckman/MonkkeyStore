Project Brief: Monkkey Webshop

**Executive Summary**

Monkkey is a project to create a webshop that solves the growing problem of impersonal gifts in both personal and corporate settings. Our product concept is to offer 100% handcrafted and personalized items, including laser-cut wooden gifts combined with 3D-printed elements, and handmade candles and soaps. The webshop will provide an intuitive and user-friendly platform for customers to find and order unique gifts, elevating the gift-giving experience. Our key value proposition is to provide truly personalized gifts that create happy moments and foster better relationships.

**Problem Statement**

The modern gift-giving market is dominated by large e-commerce platforms like Amazon and bol.com, where consumers default to traditional, mass-produced gifts such as socks, perfume, jewelry, and clothing. This trend has led to a lack of personality and originality in gift-giving. For customers seeking truly unique, handcrafted, and personalized items, the process is often fragmented and difficult, as personalized messages are typically just printed on generic, big-brand products.

This problem is significant because it erodes the emotional value of gift-giving, replacing it with a transactional experience. The market lacks a centralized platform that offers a curated portfolio of genuinely personal and natural goods. Monkkey aims to solve this by providing a dedicated space for 100% natural and personal gifts that carry a deeper, more meaningful message, ultimately creating moments of true happiness.

**Proposed Solution**

The Monkkey Webshop is a custom-built e-commerce platform designed to directly address the need for authentic, handcrafted, and personalized gifts. The solution will feature a unique dual-interface approach, with two distinct sections: one for individual consumers and one for corporate clients.

For consumers, the platform will be a highly focused and user-friendly webshop that emphasizes single, personalized gifts. The user experience will be streamlined to promote customization options like engraving personal messages and images, ensuring a seamless and intuitive process.

For the corporate sector, the platform will be tailored for business-to-business (B2B) relationships, focusing on the high-volume sale of curated gift boxes. This section will be designed to handle bulk orders and facilitate larger transactions efficiently, providing a professional and dedicated experience for corporate clients.

The key differentiators of this webshop are its exclusive focus on 100% handcrafted items and the deep personalization options not found on larger, mass-market platforms. By avoiding generic, off-the-shelf solutions like Shopify or WooCommerce, this custom platform will provide a unique digital experience that directly reflects the artisanal quality of the products, creating a more intimate connection between the customer and the gifts they are giving.

**Target Users**

This project is designed to cater to two distinct user segments with unique needs and behaviors.

Primary User Segment: Corporate & Professional Businesses
This segment consists of HR teams, managers, and corporate relations specialists seeking attention gifts, employee appreciation packages, or onboarding kits.

Behaviors: These users typically need to order gifts in bulk and require comprehensive services beyond just the product, including crafting, wrapping, and delivery. They are focused on finding solutions that are efficient and reliable for large-volume orders.

Pain Points: A major pain point is the lack of thoughtful and original corporate gifting options. They are tired of the same impersonal choices like snack boxes and branded notepads, which often fail to convey genuine appreciation.

Needs: Their primary needs are to find gifts that are more unique and personal, can be ordered in bulk, and come with a full-service solution for packaging and delivery. They want to be able to show their employees and B2B relationships that they are truly valued.

Secondary User Segment: Consumers
This segment consists of individual customers looking for home gifts with a personal touch.

Behaviors: These users are often seeking highly personalized and unique gifts for specific occasions, such as birthdays or baby showers. They are motivated by the emotional value of the gift and the message it conveys.

Needs: Their needs are centered around finding handcrafted items with deep personalization options. They are looking for gifts that can be customized with personal messages or names, such as candles in a laser-cut wooden box or birth gifts with a newborn's name, to create a sense of true happiness and connection.
